1.What is Moore's Law and why is it relevant to computing?
	Moore's law is the trend of tansistor doubling in computers every two years. This doubling allowed for faster CPU clocks.
	This trend is useful but, at a certain point faster speeds cause heat problems. So instead of simply shoving as many transistors as possible,
	many processor makers and using the increasingly small size of transistors to make multi-cored architecture with instruction level parallelism.

2.What is the significance of processor clock speed? If we measure processor computational power as FLOPS, how could a 500 Mhz processor out perform a 1 Ghz processor?
	A two core 500 Mhz processor would preform the same number of FLOPS in a second as a 1 core 1 Ghz processor. 
	To outpreform the 1Ghz processor the 500 Mhz processor would have to have more than twice the number of cores the 1 Ghz processor contains.
 
3.What are some ways we might measure and compare computer capability? List FLOPS and two options, discuss strengths/weaknesses of each.
	FLOPS: The number of floating point operations that the cluster can complete per second.
		+ standardizes a metric for rate of computation
		- Does not think about power usage to produce those flops. metric is removed from real world of building systems.
		- does not reveal load distribution across the cluster, just tot computational power.
	FLOPS/W: flops per watt
		+ useful for system planning. assists in cost vs power analysis
		- not particularly useful in terms of upping the speed of a system. 
		/ not a rate metric
	I/Oops: the number of input and output operation a cluster can preform in a second.
		+ Useful for database systems that do a tremendous amount of writing and reading
		-not a measure of computational power, more a measure of information transportation power.
		-does not consider load distribution, between nodes, only total information movement power.
