data dependencies: between the instructions and x
overhead is higher for parallelism.
think about work in serial versus parallel terms
Amdahl's law: width of the graph is the number of cores that could be maximally efficient
number of cores usefulness is maxed at width
formulas: t_onecore = Wser + Wpar
          t_pcores = Wser + Wpar/#cores

Gustafvson-Barres: parallel speedup grows muh faster than serial speedup grows
